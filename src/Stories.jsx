If I didn't have a subsidized program, I would pay $2,900/month for meds-- $6,000/month if I didn't have private insurance. That's more than my rent and groceries. I fight for those who often don't have a chance to vote as a social worker. I'm sure that there are millions of people who haven't had a chance to vote because they were ill or for many other intersectional reasons, yet would if they had a chance. That's a large number that would lose coverage. Please consider those who haven't been able to stand up for themselves."

Since getting insurance from Obamacare I was able to get treatment for HepC which I contracted from blood transfusion when I delivered my daughter 28. I was able to visit a range of doctors for preventive care including getting colonoscopy, I am in high risk since my mother died at 49 from colon cancer. I am sure I would be in worse health or dead without this insurance \n\nMy son 31 is bi-polar and He is currently being monitored by a doctor and getting adjustments to his medicine. I know without this insurance my son would go back to being hospitalized and the bills will pile up causing more stress"

        text: 'I\'ve been sick with Crohn\'s disease since I was 14. When I tried to go to college, I became too sick to continue after only a few weeks. I dropped out, and my doctor recommended a 3 step surgical procedure. The ACA was brand new at the time, and because I was under 26, I didn\'t have to worry about getting kicked from my parents\' health insurance just when I needed it the most, despite the loss of my status as a full-time student. My dad was even able to leave a job he hated between two of my surgeries without fear that his new insurance would drop me. Those surgeries changed my life, and I do not think I would be alive today if I hadn\'t been able to have them. Afterwards, I was able to go back to college and finish my degree. Nowadays I work and hold my own insurance through my employer, but I am still very expensive, and I live in fear of the return of lifetime and annual caps. And if we go back to a world in which I have to maintain continuous coverage in order to avoid discrimination against my preexisting condition, what will happen to me if I ever have another period in which I\'m too sick to work?'

And I have a pre existing condition. If the ACA is gutted, I will not be able to afford health insurance and prescription prices will go up, possibly beyond my ability to afford them.  I can\'t believe how cruel the republican party is to want to stop something that works out of spite and selfishness. I think if you want to save money congress should defund its members\' healthcare benefits and other other perks so they will just how much these things cost the average person.'
